# NS1nanosynth_sketches

This repository hosts WIP firmware projects for the Soundmachines NS-1 nanosynth.
These projects are all Arduino-like and they are to be programmed onto the on-board Arduino Leonardo.

At the moment I'm hosting the following novel source code:
- NSequencer3: MIDI/CV sequencer for NS-1. Compatible with Ableton Live. It also drives RGB digits.
